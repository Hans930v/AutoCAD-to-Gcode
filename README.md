# AutoCAD to G-Code  
AutoLISP-based commands for generating G-code directly from AutoCAD drawings.  
Easily create **G0**, **G1**, **G2**, and **G3** moves with feedrate and plane selection (**G17/G18/G19**) â€” perfect for CNC users who want lightweight, script-based G-code generation inside AutoCAD.
