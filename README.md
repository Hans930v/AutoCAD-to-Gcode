# AutoCAD-to-Gcode
AutoLISP-based commands for generating G-code from AutoCAD. Provides interactive commands for generating G0, G1, G2, and G3 moves with feedrate and plane selection (G17/G18/G19).  

I post tutorials and demos on how to import & use these commands and generate G-Code directly from AutoCAD.
